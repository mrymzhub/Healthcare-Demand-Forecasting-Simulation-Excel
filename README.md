# 👶 Neonatal Care Simulation Project

This project simulates various aspects of neonatal care to assist healthcare professionals and administrators in understanding resource allocation, patient flow, and outcomes in neonatal units. The simulation is designed to support data-driven decision-making in neonatal healthcare services.

## 📁 Project Overview

The simulation analyzes data related to neonatal patient care using structured data in Excel format. It can be used for:
- Evaluating resource utilization (beds, staff, equipment)
- Assessing patient outcomes based on treatment plans
- Modeling length of stay and care progression
- Supporting policy development and service improvements

## 🩺 Purpose

To improve clinical and operational outcomes in neonatal units by:
- Identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- Testing different care strategies
- Supporting evidence-based healthcare planning

## 🧾 Dataset

**File**: `neonatalCareSimulation.xlsx`

Includes:
- Patient demographics and clinical indicators
- Simulation parameters (e.g., arrival rate, care duration)
- Outcome variables (e.g., discharge status, survival rate)
- Resource constraints (e.g., nurse-patient ratios)

> Note: All data used is either simulated or anonymized to ensure confidentiality and privacy compliance.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Open the Excel file with a spreadsheet tool (Excel, LibreOffice, or Google Sheets).
2. Navigate through the sheets:
   - **Input Parameters**: Modify these for different simulation runs
   - **Patient Data**: View or simulate patient flow
   - **Results/Output**: Analyze outcomes based on current configuration

3. Optionally, load the Excel data into Python or R for advanced simulation or visualization.

## 💡 Example Use Cases

- Project the number of NICU beds required for future years
- Evaluate effects of changes in nurse staffing levels
- Study the impact of earlier intervention on outcomes

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Excel for simulation modeling
- (Optional) Python or R for advanced analysis

## 📊 Visualizations (if applicable)

If integrated with Jupyter or BI tools, possible visuals include:
- Patient flow charts
- Outcome heatmaps
- Resource utilization dashboards

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Integration with real-time hospital data
- Automated alerts for critical thresholds
- Web-based dashboard (e.g., Streamlit or Dash)
